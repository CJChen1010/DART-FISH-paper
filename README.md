# DART-FISH-paper
This repository is used to document scripts to analyze DART-FISH dataset from human primary motor cortex (M1C). 

## Summary
We developed a custom spatial transcriptomics method, DART-FISH ( Decoding Amplified taRgeted Transcripts with Fluorescence in situ Hybridization). For detailed protocol of DART-FISH, please see our paper on Nature Communications ([Mapping human tissues with highly multiplexed RNA in situ hybridization](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46437-y)). We used DART-FISH to measure 121 genes in the spatial context of human M1C tissue and compare the spatial distribution of some marker genes to the gold standard smFISH.
